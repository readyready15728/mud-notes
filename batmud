When you enter the game you will be in Dortlewall at the beginning of the first tutorial. Dortlewall offers a lot of tutorials which are designed to teach you how to play the game. The village is a safe place so you can easily wander around the town to have a look. There's also a crystite mine within the town which is a small area designed particularly for new players. Dortlewall also offers a lot of basic services, such as adventurers' guild and portals to race shrine or to Damogran's warehouse in Arelium.

--

scan/x can be used to see opponent condition; consider (can't be shortened), to see how good a fighter they are

--

To flee from battle, simply walk out of the room, use wimpy now or set your wimpy before the battle and hope for the best. (Actually don't use wimpy.)

--

Handling multiple items of the same type can be done by first using eqnumber to identify the correct item and then just by adding the corresponding number to the wield or wear command. For example, if you have two rings, you can do eqnumber ring to see which ring is which, and then wear ring 2. As a rule of thumb the last gotten item is 1, and so on, but to order items in inventory you can use the juggle command.

--

Once your enemy is dead, you can loot the remains. This is easiest done with get all from corpse (or gac for short). With rip_action you can define your actions to be performed automatically everytime a monster dies. It is good practice to dispose of the body, so it will not come back to haunt you. The simplest way is to dig grave - a shovel speeds up the process. If there are multiple corpses to be looted, loot loots them all. 

--

'ansi items dull cyan' makes item descriptions much more legible; 'ansi roomshort light yellow' (or similar) marks the beginnings of room descriptions clearly which is also very helpful

--

The path forks to three here. You must make a choice now. To help with that choice, you can try commands exits and peer, that is, peer southwest for example. Go on, try and peer southwest, south and southeast, and pick a direction to continue your way.

--

There are many kinds of interactions: interacting with other players with tells or by emoting and interacting with monsters. Most commonly you talk to monsters with ask <monstername> about <subject>. If the "monster ignores you", it typically means it will not speak anything when using ask. Another less common way is to talk to <monstername>. Talking with other players can be done over channels or by using tell to communicate directly. If you want to express different feelings to someone, you can use emote with desired feelings and adverbs.

--

Sometimes you will get into a situation where you are fighting many opponents at once. Instead of throwing haymakers randomly at each one of them, you should target one opponent at a time. This will ensure a faster victory which in turn means more money, equipment and fame.

--

Doors and locks are for honest people they say. It seems that there are a lot of honest people in BatMUD. Not all doors have locks and not all locks have keys for them. Some doors open with a password, some with thievery and some just by knocking politely. To open a locked door with a key, simply unlock door if you have the required key in your inventory. To open the second door in a room, use unlock door 2, and so on. Usually it isn't required to open the door with open door, you can just walk into the direction of the door and you'll automatically open and close it afterwards. You can also lock door if you have the key for it in your inventory. Also worth noting: closed doors won't show as obvious exits, but exits command shows them.

--

Whee, you are out of that stinking cave. And someone has already built a campsite for you to use. You can start with sleep. That means you start looking for a place to sleep, and after a while you are sound asleep. After that, you can contemplate your past experiences. That means level up time! Type advance level. You can do this almost everywhere, if you have the experience required (you can check that with advance cost). After you're done resting, continue south.

--

You are getting closer to your destination. Time for some more lessons before the final battle. This lesson is about skills and spells, and how to use or cast them. Now, check your skills (just type that). Every skill and spell has its own helpfile, accessible via help skill skillname, for example help skill punch. Same goes for spells, help spell spellname. Don't worry if this is confusing, your tutorial will remember these lessons and you can check them out again later.

'[channel] last' gets channel history

--

The forest gives way to a field, and you can see the village further south. Time to learn to use your skills and spells. The ring you found at the beginning gives you the knowledge of spell shocking grasp and skill punch. Syntax for using a skill is use skillname at targetname. You can usually omit the 'at targetname' if there is an obvious target, like in combat. Spells are similar, cast spellname at targetname. Feeling a bit mischievous? You could try cast shocking grasp at scarecrow or if you don't have enough spell points, use punch at scarecrow.

--

Dawnmist the dryad, welcoming new adventurers
Dawnmist says 'Hello, Khwarizmi. I sense you have the ring. You can give it to me and I'll deliver it to master Tayrien.'    
She seems legitimate. You should keep remove ring to remove it from your keep list and give ring to dawnmist.

--

Please don't go yet! In all seriousness, take a break once in a while, it's good for your health. The usual methods of quitting are ld and quit.

Ld stands for link death and it will remember your location, up till a reboot happens. It allows you to leave with your equipment still on, and is the usual method of leaving for a while. Link death also happens when there are network problems or you close your client.
               
If you type quit, you will go link dead. But if you try quit real it will log you out, clear temporary effects and transport you to your starting location when you re-enter the game. The downside is, you cannot quit real when carrying equipment. You can set your starting location with the start command.

The third option is inns and find campsite skill. They both act as quit real, but with the difference that you re-enter the game at the same location you left, with your equipment on you. This location saving stays even over reboots.

Oh, a funny little detail is that you can do for example ld getting groceries and your finger info will show that text when you are out. Same works for quit and quit real.

--

The major cities of BatMUD hold everything an adventurer needs, from shops to churches and guilds to restaurants. You will find that the cities are mapped and have friendly guards patrolling the streets. You can always talk to guard and ask for directions. The guards will mark your destination for you. The directions are visible in look on the streets, in the form of Dest: direction in the top right corner. Also notable for city navigation is the command map. It shows a bigger view of the city, with nearby locations.
Dortlewall-special: you can describe map on the streets for a short key to the map.

--

Despite trying to be thorough, this tutorial can't take everything into account. If you need extra help with something, you can ask on the newbie channel. For example, to say hello on the channel, you would type newbie hello. Newbie channel differs from other channels in that harmful 'advice' is prohibited, making it a safe place to ask newbie questions.

There is also another way of getting help. There are some designated newbie helpers, which you can see with whos helper, or whos helper unidle for listing only the ones that are more or less present at the moment. Pick one, and then tell <helpername> <your question>. Being polite will help getting an answer.

Don't panic.

--

* 'skills offensive' shows which skills you have that incur a chance of goading mobs into attacking
* 'show effects' is equivalent to 'affects' in other MUDs
* Dual-wielding is more useful than in real life
* Use 'heft' and 'compare' to assess weapons
* Containers can be opened with 'force' with some obvious risk of traps going off; the same goes for breaking it with skills and spells

--

Knowing how to handle your inventory is an important skill. First of all, your inventory is split in two: items in keep and items not in keep. Kept items are harder to lose by accident than not-kept, since you cannot drop, give or sell kept items. Another big division is equipment and inventory.

Your worn items are not shown in inventory, but in equipment.

The basic commands of inventory handling are get for getting something from the room you are in, or from a bag or chest or something. Getting rid of items is done with drop. To put something in a bag or a rig you use put. To give something, just use give. To keep and unkeep items you can use keep.    

Other useful commands are eqnumber, juggle and count.

What are rigs, you might ask. They are a piece of equipment that allows you to carry heavy loads a bit easier. Anything put inside weighs a little less.

One more thing about handling items. If there are many similar items, lets say axes, you can target the second one with axe 2, and the third one with axe 3. Eqnumber axe command helps finding out which axe is which. Help handling has some nice info too.

--

Money makes the world go around, or so they say. There are 11 coin types, the basic coin being the gold coin. Each coin weighs 1 gram, which means you will get burdened fast if you collect each and every coin you meet. The usual ways of storing coins are purses, bought from player city furniture stores (beware of cheap replicas), coffers made by player merchants, and last but not the least - banks.

Banks deal only in gold coins, making the higher nomination coins a bit more valuable than what their buying value is. This is because it is easier to store a few mithril coins than a big pile of gold coins. Why not have all your money in bank, then? Well, banks, safe as they may seem, get sometimes robbed for about 10% of your account. One more thing about banks in BatMUD: all the banks are branches of the same company, so if you deposit coins in one, you can withdraw from any of the other banks.

So, how much is much, and what does your gold coins buy? Usually magical items go for from measly 10k-15k (k means thousands) to several millions (M for short) pieces of gold. Unique items may fetch even hundreds of millions, but seeing one of those for sale is really rare. Guild levels usually cost some money too, to a maximum of about 2M. The amount is substantially less for low-levelers, about 100k for first guild. A good middle range item is usually about 200k.                                                          

--

Most shop-bought items are of low quality. That is why you usually buy your more precious items from other players. You might wonder how does the sellers and buyers find each other. There are several ways: sales channel, broker command, auction house, merchant carts and we even have a news group for rare and precious items.

Sales channel is just that - a channel for advertising stuff for sale. You can turn the channel on with sales on, just like any other channel. Often you see someone mentioning broker on the channel. Broker is a command that lists the items a person is selling, among other things. You should read its helpfile for more uses.

When you and the other person have agreed upon the price, it's time to meet and trade. You, being the newcomer, usually have to provide your part of the trade first. If you want to play it safe, you can use trading room in Arelium, but its cost, 10%, and the extra effort it requires are usually shunned upon. Auction house is another somewhat rarely used feature, allowing you to sell stuff even when you are not online. It costs to use, though.
  
Merchant carts, or cubes as they are also known, are a specialty of the merchant guild. You can list the wares of a cart with look at cube #, and buy stuff from the cube with buy # from cube #, where #'s are numbers.

The news group is mostly for rare items only, items that fetch millions of gold pieces. Oh, another thing worth mentioning: no trading with RL stuff, as help trading clearly states.

--

lite ghost [legible color] is useful; as is lite wanted [stand-out color] and lite sales [stand-out color]

--

Search is a very important command. The usual way of finding secret rooms and items is to first look at the suspected item, then search the same item. For example, if the room description has a tree in it, you should first look at tree to maybe find clues, and then search tree to see if this closer inspection reveals anything.

Remember, while Dortlewall has most of the inspectable items highlighted, this isn't the case outside - you have to read the room description and think a bit about which items are significant and which aren't.

--

Sometimes you will get lost. Knowing a few ways to locate yourself is then in order. The command whereami tells you where you are. If you know perfectly well where you are, but need to know where your party members are, the command whereismyparty is the right one to use. After getting the coordinates, take a look at help ferries and you'll find maps to use with those coordinates.

Locating yourself using the Batclient is a bit easier, since it has built-in realm map. It shows your current location, along with the locations of your party members.

--

You found the way to activate granite posts - that is, touching them. The one you found was malfunctioning, and didn't transport you deep into the bedrock, like a normal one would. In fact, it did absolutely nothing, except sputter. What a letdown.

--

Practically any map that is not logical or is even remotely confusing, is called a maze around these parts. In a maze you can walk to one direction and end up in the same room from which you left. Usually, when you notice that you are in a maze, it is already too late. Solving mazes can be time-consuming, but at the same time, very rewarding. To solve the simplest mazes just drop some coins to mark the rooms and write down notes.

--

It is somewhat jokingly said that the Arelium moat has claimed more victims than any individual monster. Drowning is a real hazard when dealing with water. The two most notable ways to drown are failing your swim check when wandering into area of deep water and being trapped underwater. In the first case, the thing number one to remember is: don't panic. If you panic and try to run away from the water, the chances are that you will just fail another swim check and take more damage. The way things are, you can just wait to get your hit points back and try again. Being trapped underwater on the other hand requires almost immediate action, since you can't just wait your health to return - on the contrary, the more you wait the more likely it is that you will drown.

There are plenty of ways to avoid drowning. The most common way is to train your swim skill, or if you are more of a caster type, study a water walking spell or some sort of floating spell. Some rare equipment also offer ways to float above water. Avoiding water altogether is also a good way.

Apart from drowning, water can be hazardous to some races. For example, thrikhrens, trolls, tinmen and vampires will take damage from water exposure. It is also worth noting that skeletons and other true undead races won't drown.

--

The world of BatMUD is split into continents. The most reliable way of travelling across the deep oceans between is taking the ferry. Consult the map sites on help ferries to locate the ferry stations, walk there and travel <continent>, where <continent> is the name of your destination: Laenor, Rothikgen, Desolathya, Lucentium or Furnachia. The cost of the trip varies by your level, and you can check it at the ticketmaster with cost before booking a trip.

At some point you might want to own a ship of your own. While not exactly a newbie purchase, you can consult your local player merchants about prices.

--

During your adventures you are likely to get hungry and thirsty. While not directly lethal, staying satiated and refreshed is recommended. Being hungry or thirsty makes you recover hit points, spell points and endurance points slower. If you are starving or dehydrated, the reduction is even bigger. You can see your hunger and thirst in score.

Famished means you are really hungry and you should eat something. Usual ways of getting something to eat are hunting and cooking skills, create food and satiate person spells, tinning kits and of course buying a meal from a shop. Some races are able to consume raw corpses.

Thirst is countered by having a drink. You can drink from rivers and lakes, but swamps and sea are poor places to have a drink. Fountains are usually safe. Of course, magic also helps, as satiate person spell helps with thirst too.

There are some bonuses for eating certain foodstuffs. Some heal you instantly, others may offer some other bonuses, as shown in show effects.
                        

--

In the heat of battle, missing that one crucial heartbeat due to a typo can be the difference between life and death. So, the next time you want to "cast telekinetic whirlwind at Rechendak, the Elementalist" you can either type it real fast or use commands and aliases. The former is used to create shortcuts for various commands and the latter is to ease typing some ridiculously long names. For example, you could just do "ctw rechie" instead.

--

You can change various aspects of your gaming experience with set. The command set show lists the options and your current settings. You can get more help about the settings with set # where # is the number of the setting you wish to learn about. You can also use the name of the setting - it is actually recommended to use the name if you for example use set in a command. For example, if you wish to create a long walking command, set look_on_move off will reduce the spam it generates. Just remember to turn it back on, too.

--

Immortal is a common term for the maintainers and world creators of BatMUD. Most immortals are wizards, but some have been granted the status of archwizard.                                                                  

A few of the basic ways of contacting immortals are tells, the bug command and the typo command. The bug command is mainly used for reporting bugs, and typo command for typos. Correctly addressing bugs helps the maintainers do their thing: if it's about area, just type bug in the area, if it's about an item you have, a sword for example, type bug sword, if it is about something else, try consulting help who to ask. Same goes for typos.

When contacting an immortal, be polite, but don't overdo it. The help files help politeness and help how to ask questions are both good reads.

How can you tell who is immortal and who not? On channels, you can immediately tell who is an immortal by their pointy <> braces. You can do who wiz, or you can simply finger the person in question, which will tell you if the character is an immortal (wizard) or an archwizard.

--

There are a few commands you can use to customize how your character looks like to others. First, the command desc allows you to set your description in look. It uses the BatMUD standard text editor, so reading help editor might be smart beforehand. 

Second, the command plan allows you to set up your plan which is shown in finger. It also uses the editor, so same warning applies as for desc. 
 
On level 5 and afterwards you can set your title - that is the text after your name and race in look and who. 
 
On level 10 and afterwards you can set your surname. Be warned, you cannot change it freely. If you for some reason grow irritated at your surname, you can either hide it or ask a player merchant for a surname clearing. It will cost a pretty penny, though. 

Also worth knowing are the commands url and top10. The former sets your url and the latter the monster kills. Both of these are shown in your finger info.

--

At some point you will be given the option to train skills and study spells. This uses up experience, but is the only way to gain new skills and spells after advancing to level 10, so it is well worth it.

Please read help train, it lists all the options for training and studying, just replace train with study for spells. It is a lot easier to type train attack to:60 than type 60 times train attack, after all!

Your first chance of training skills and studying spells is usually your race guild after advancing to level 11. It is located somewhere on the world map, but for ease of access you can use the various race shrine portals - there is one even in Dortlewall's guildhouse.

--

In BatMUD, guilds are what other places usually call classes: they offer skills and spells to train, and define your character's capabilities. The guilds of other places are called (secret) societies here.

The guilds you can join depend on your background, which you chose at character creation. The command show guilds shows your background, among other things, if you happen to forget what you chose. It is important to join a guild and advance levels in it, since guilds are the only place
offering skills to train and spells to study. You can join your racial guild at level 11, and a real guild at level 16 after taking all the race guild levels. If you think you made a mistake in character creation, visit the wise sages of Dortlewall, in southeast corner of Wizard's square. They can tell you about reincarnation.

--

During your travels you might make new friends, or enemies. You can keep track of these people with friends command. Basically you can do friends -a heidel or friends -a heidel asshats. The former adds Heidel to your primary friends list, the latter to asshats-list. After adding people to your friends list you can simply type friends or friends asshats to see people online on your friends lists. Combined with inform friends you can easily see when people you like or dislike enter or leave the game.

--

There is strength in numbers. Grouping or partying is an effective way of increasing your chances of success. A party can consist of up to 9 members, placed in a 3x3 grid. The people in the front row are nicknamed "tanks" and behind them, out of harm's reach, are the "casters". The party always has a leader whom the others follow. Gathering a party can prove tricky at first, but once your skills, power and reputation have increased, it will get easier. 
 
You form a party with party create <partyname>, invite people in with party invite <playername>, join someone else's party after invitation with party join, leave the party with party leave, communicate with party members with party say <message> (p' for short) and so on. For full list of party commands, try help party.

--

Secret societies are (usually) player formed societies, or guilds. They offer (usually) a channel for chatting with selected people. Sometimes they also offer bonuses, but those bonuses come with a cost: the levels taken are taken from the same pool that you would use to advance in regular guilds, and some of the bonuses, namely stat bonuses, require exp to train. 
 
Should you get an invitation to one of these societies, you can join it either in the society's very own room, located in a player city (usually the inviter can tell you where it is), or at the society joining room in Arelium for a small cost. Consult the cityguards for directions, destination is 'Hall of Heroes'.

--

Houses are small communities that may be founded once you reach level 50. They bring different bonuses (and responsibilities), but to prosper the house needs all kinds of players, even new players. Houses have their own channel where only house members may discuss and it's often a good forum for asking beginner questions from more experienced players. You may join a house either in population register office in Arelium or by visiting the guildhouse in Dortlewall. Command house may be used to get information about a house.

--

So, your leech Barbarian was not such a good idea after all. No worries. One of the best features of this world is the ability to reincarnate again to another race and background. You will need to ask for a reinc on the wanted channel, pay the reincer some gold, die and accept the reinc. Once the spell has been cast you will be taxed a bit of experience and you are back in the creation room. 

For true newbies it is even easier, just recreate without any penalties.

--

The only thing that is certain in the world is death. Nothing or no-one can escape it. Luckily, in BatMUD, you can come back to life and avenge your death... or turn the other cheek. Once in hell or heaven, you have some options: pray or ask for a raise dead, resurrect or a new body on the ghost channel. Every death will age you and give you lower stats for a short while. In addition, you will lose a part of your carried experience depending on which method you take. If there are no raisers listening to the ghost channel, an NPC called Theresa can provide you some services at slightly higher penalties.

--

Part of the fun of MUDs is other people. The command tell is the usual way of contacting other people. For example, you could do tell heidel hello t tell the creature known as heidel 'hello'. If you have received a tell, you can do tell * <message> to reply to the tell, or tell last to review your last tells. If the tell you received was for multiple people, you can reply to all of the recipients with tell ** <message>.

If you made a mistake in the target part of a tell, you can use retell to re-send the tell to a new target. You can contact someone's party with ptell. You can report your current health or stats to someone with report. If you want to say something to the people in the same room, you can use say. If someone harasses or annoys you with any of these communication methods, there is a command to ignore someone: ignore.

While all of these commands are useful to know, you'll do just fine by remembering only tell, say and ignore.

One more major topic: channels. You can use channels to communicate with friends and strangers alike. The newbie channel is your best bet on asking questions about BatMUD right now. Most channels work by typing in the name of the channel and then the message, for example bat hello, but some channels require you to add say before the message, most notably the guild channels. There are some 'magic words' you can use with channels, just try to say them on a channel: on to turn a channel on, off to turn it off, last to review the channel history, and who to see the people listening to the channel.

|                                                     |
|  Greetings, o brave adventurer! Manyfold are the    |
|  places you can reach through this chamber; some    |
|  far from the good Arelium, some near. The magic    |
|  word is 'go', as in 'go digga' which would take    |
|  you to Digga's Newbie Forest.                      |
|                                                     |
|  Below a list of choices and brief explanations.    |
|                                                     |
|  'beach'      - north to the beach.                 |
|  'beastlands' - south to the valley.                |
|  'church'     - west into the church                |
|  'desert'     - enter into the fields               |
|  'digga'      - go north to reach the forest.       |
|  'garden'     - path to enter it.                   |
|  'grove'      - south to the apple grove.           |
|  'mines'      - down into the newbie mines.         |

'-----------------------------------------------------'

--

Nearest granite post to Arelium is apparently petting zoo. (Actually there is one just in front of the church entrance in Arelium.)

--

In Arelium, armor and weapons need to be sold to the right store (normal or luxury)

--

Movement
--------

You move by typing in the direction, for example 'north' or 'enter'. You can shorten the basic directions, so 'n' works just like 'north' and 'ne' just like 'northeast'. You can move several rooms with '# e'. The number # is limited to 20. For example, if you type '8 e' you'll try to move 8 times to east. At certain level you can use this to repeat other commands, too. (help parser)

On the overworld map, and in some cities, you can use capital letters to move several rooms: 'SE' will move 20 rooms southeast, or until the terrain changes. If you are on a road, you can use the 'travel' command, which has its own nifty help file (help travel).

That's it, the basics of movement in batmud, happy adventuring.

Upon entering the bazaar, type "join" to join the merchant's guild. It is necessary to go up in the bazaar to access the guild even if you can't see that exit.

To become a runemage:

* Find one of the entrances to the guild
* Find Winston (2nd floor) and ask about lecture; sitting down on bench for lecture appears to be needed
* Find Fanny (3rd floor) and join
* Find Reuben (1st floor) and step on pedestal desired number of times to advance level; all this requires is gold so beware of going too far all at once and using up free levels
* Find Ethelwine (1st floor) and start training; because this is a lengthy process it is advisable to use e.g. "train runescribing next:10"
* Three skills directly relevant to runic magic can be trained; I understand that runic research is the most important of the lot initially but also plant lore and mining are also important for supporting the path of runic magic
* There is a shop on the 2nd floor that sells runestones and tools related to discovering the runes (which can presumably also be found in a general store)

The priest guildmaster is on the continent of Furnachia. Take the ferry there from Laenor and go south out of Rilynt'tar. He is said to be wandering in the wastelands somewhere to the northwest of the bridge over lava south of Rilynt'tar. Complicating things, there are two such bridges. However, when someone showed me the way, he was near the western of the two bridges. Additionally, he was marked as an "m" for me.

Spider guild is pretty lame if you don't have a spider demon

[01:05]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: I'm becoming increasingly neutral in alignment, wat do wat do?
[01:05]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: (I should be evil)
[01:05]:Darna [newbie]: kill more good mobs
[01:05]:Bullwinkle [newbie]: kill more good mobs?
[01:05]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: I wonder where I can find them
[01:05]:Tubador [newbie]: according to my mum, masturbation works too
[01:05]:Endure the Helper [newbie]: do evil stuff like drains, desecrate ground, etc
[01:06]:Darna [newbie]: in Arelium church, priests are good, monks are evil

--

When you die, Death carries you to Hell (or Heaven, if you're good). In BatMUD death is just temporary, and simply a part of everyday gaming. It is important to have a high charisma score when dying, otherwise you risk all kinds of negative effects when getting back alive.

--

I've been told that energy drain and mana drain are for use against other players and are not very useful, if at all

--

Arelium has pretty good XP opportunities if you're in the 30s levels and also has a number of good-aligned mobs to maintain an evil alignment; this is also true of orphans and nuns in the orphanage :p

--

The portal in the Church of All Gods in Arelium is very useful

[04:32]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: What effect does kiss of death really have?
[04:33]:Mancomb [newbie]: Some extra damage, small heal if monster killed during the kiss effect
[04:33]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Neat

--

On when the skill "chaotic spawn" is any good:

Maush [bat]: you need to build rep for it to get better (just kill monsters while spawned)

For even more detail: http://taikajuoma.ovh/wiki/Chaotic_spawn

There appears to be an XP penalty when in chaotic spawn form; also regeneration requires darkness (which of course can be achieved with the spell of the same name)

--

Tower guards in the Lands of Lore have teleport ability; beware

--

[21:16]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: When someone says "party for mage" in wanted does that mean they have a party needing a mage or that they are a mage and want to join a party?
[21:16]:Yggdrasil [newbie]: latter
[21:17]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: OK
[21:18]:Yggdrasil [newbie]: the former would be "mage for exp", "mage for grimoor" etc on wanted

--

Using offensive magic while fighting then healing after defeating the opponent (or after wimpy triggers) is more efficient by far

--

http://www.bat.org/community/library?str=173

But beware! Not all weapons allow wielding in one hand (and therefore the ability to inflict harm as a priest)

--

[00:16]:Khwarizmi [bat]: These overworld monsters are too much effort for the XP they give
[00:16]:Eronk (bat): help skill consider, if you get it
[00:16]:Voima (bat): yes they are, they haz too nasty specials
[00:16]:Yggdrasil [bat]: some are sometimes very good exp actually
[00:18]:Yggdrasil [bat]: mobs get killed, they will give less exp. mobs don't get killed, they give good exp, are in "good tune"
[00:18]:Moor [bat]: so your best experience will be in the Zonni Swamp
[00:18]:Voima (bat): and even elephant is limber as hell, parries and ripostes like crazy
[00:19]:Moor [bat]: has a trunk
[00:19]:Moor [bat]: even its ears are bigger than you
[00:19]:Khwarizmi [bat]: Didn't know I had to use consider

--

use consider at mob

--

(00:20) Eronk tells you 'mainly consider is used to see the exp worth of mob'
(00:20) Eronk tells you 'but you need higher skill for it'
(00:20) Eronk tells you 'for example "You would get some experience for
 Golem."'
(00:21) Eronk tells you 'means it's not worth much compared to it's toughness'
(00:21) Eronk tells you 'it is affected by how often you have kileld the monster and how often other players have killed it'

--

(19:51) Pirutar tells you 'the more you or other people kill same mob the worse tune it will be'
(19:51) Pirutar tells you 'thats why you need to rotate places where you exp'
(19:51) Pirutar tells you 'use consider at mob, it will say what tune its in'
(19:52) Pirutar tells you 'later on you learn how much exp mobs you regularly kill gives like if you do mobs that normally give 5000k exp and then one day you go and see its only 1000, you know from that already that its in bad tune and maybe rest of the area too'
(19:53) Pirutar tells you 'outerworld mobs generally are bad exp, should do exp inside areas and vary them too so dont do same area too often, for newbie tune isnt that hard so maybe can do one area twice per boot if have long time between going there like 6h +'

--

(19:55) Pirutar tells you 'in some areas theres same mob several times, and in
 older area those mobs are usually clones, which means if you kill those mobs
 with same name its like killing one mob several times, and that affects the
 tune too'

--

(19:57) Pirutar tells you 'unfortunately on top of personal tune theres global tune too'
(19:57) Pirutar tells you 'so even if you dont fuck up tune someone else might do it for you =)'
(19:57) Pirutar tells you 'oh coffee forest supposedly really nice newish newbie area on luce but im too big so i dont know what size those are'
(19:58) Pirutar tells you 'yep its especially bad if killing repops (or those clone mobs), theres like some 1 hour rule if you rekill mob within hour of last time you or someone else did it it will have big negative effect on tune then'

--

Note to self: use crystite mine on next reinc; crystite isn't mined by player characters but one can kill mobs for it

--

Buy a sleeping bag at the Dortlewall general store; it weighs nothing and helps with regen (but
one needs the camping skill to use it)

--

The equipment that is removed when you invoke chaotic spawn can be reworn / rewielded; additionally higher levels of chaotic spawn open up new ring slots for the player

--

Respawning towards end of chaotic spawn effect appears more efficient than two or more separate spawns; this is done by using chaotic spawn again

--

Progress to further tentacles in chaotic spawn mode is believed to scale with difficulty / XP of monsters slain (?) but it is still common to use low-level mobs to achieve the same effect

--

Guild advancement will take money from your bank account if possible as a convenience for when you
run out of cash on hand

--

<channel> last <number> can retrieve up to 100 lines of history rather than the default 20

Bunny Valley is a good place for gaining XP at lvl 40

--

It's never too early to start joining parties; "newbie <guild> for twiddle" is a good way to advertise at lower levels

--

[22:45]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: When other players want a mage for a party can it be substituted with a priest?
[22:46]:Malcom (newbie): sometimes, mostly not
[22:46]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: People seldom seem to want priests for parties :/
[22:46]:Malcom (newbie): mages get prots that priests don't
[22:47]:Tept [newbie]: it can take some convincing.  If there's already another mage there's a better shot cause of what Malcom said

--

[04:52]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Does skill in chaotic spawn increase damage?
[04:52]:Hair the Helper (newbie): a little.  you get more str, dex, siz which help, also tentacles hit for a little bit
[04:53]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Good
[04:53]:Hair the Helper (newbie): and once you get to 3 tentacles you get an extra ring slot while spawned, and a 2nd extra one at 5 tentacles

--

[09:04]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Any advantages in especially heavy weapons? Like tungsten
[09:04]:Roak {newbie}: big smack
[09:04]:Eronk (newbie): hit harder
[09:05]:Moor [newbie]: Tungsten is especially good and gives electrical damage too

--

Damn armament works best on small weapons

--

Barkeeper in village in Perilous Forest will intervene if you use magic on the drunk there; in fact, many mobs have a hostile response to spellcasting

--

Prison in Shadowkeep is dangerous

--

Consider setting wimpy dir in advance of a big fight

--

Perilous Forest has a huge bear that will follow you around

--

[07:25]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: At what level of charisma should I start looking for surgery?
[07:25]:Anduileth [newbie]: thx
[07:27]:Merc the Helper <newbie>: I usually took surgery when i dropped below 80

--

The city portals are very useful. Just go to Esiris first to avoid having to remove all items and then use the portal in Esiris to go where you want.

--

Small Meadow in Laenor has deer that fucking GANG UP ON YOU

[13:36]:Khwarizmi [bat]: If I want to join lots of parties in my next reinc as a mage, what's my battle plan?
[13:36]:Eschaton [bat]: make lots of exp, mages need it :)
[13:38]:Eschaton [bat]: and to make your spells cheap you'll be needing reagents (which cost cash)
[13:39]:Khwarizmi [bat]: I was farming gold in Lorenchia for a while
[13:41]:Anadir (bat): generally speaking, mage may not be the best newbie guild. you need a lot of exp to make them work decently.
[13:41]:Eschaton [bat]: also, riftwalkers could be a nice addition which give you an option to solo some
[13:41]:Khwarizmi [bat]: I'm talking about a reinc
[13:41]:Valdi [bat]: Riftwalker is a pretty easy start I think
[13:41]:Anadir (bat): riftwalkers are.. a different case.
[13:42]:Eschaton [bat]: before you reinc, test it out with the reincsim at eq.batmudder.com
[13:42]:Khwarizmi [bat]: Cool
[13:43]:Anadir (bat): I wouldn't expect too much before you can take mage+inner circle + 3 type guilds and actually study the spells. But that's just me, I'm sure people have done one type mages and somehow made it work.
[13:44]:Voi (bat): say riftwalker requires inner_cirle aka conjurers, the entitys are very shitty at everything for very long time
[13:45]:Theramon (bat): but very powerful once youve given it time ;)
[13:45]:Eschaton [bat]: and a lot of fun in my opinion :)
[13:45]:Voi (bat): from riftwalker guild, you get shitty blast, shitty fabs, and rest are crap too...
[13:45]:Theramon (bat): +1
[13:45]:Theramon (bat): I love riftwalker
[13:46]:Eschaton [bat]: i love you too
[13:46]:Anadir (bat): I'm not sure I'd call pure riftwalkers mages though. I guess it's a nice newbie caster guild with ridiculous amounts of potential for growth for 15 level guild.
[13:47]:Voi (bat): and entitys are quite bad to handle, atleast they fixed some annoyance but still a lot to be tweaked... they are decent at under 30lvl and above 80lvl but between wouldnt play at all
[13:48]:Theramon (bat): play riftwalker and become baddest ass (badder than Blaykes BADASS(tm)ness(
[13:49]:Voi (bat): there are a lot better guilds to play between 30-80lvl that work nicely, with power word kill monster
[13:49]:Kohothegreat {bat}: i agree, join rangers
[13:50]:Voi (bat): yes rangers even beats rifties, and all mounted guilds
[13:50]:Sarma (bat): rangers are awesome
[13:50]:Theramon (bat): riftwalkers beat em alll
[13:50]:Anadir (bat): also, help rumors
[13:51]:Theramon (bat): also rep bat stats guilds    for best ranked guilds in game

--

The fireman in Arelium is more dangerous than he appears

--

Perhaps wimpy normal is the best setting

--

use 'descrate ground' corpse

--

Decebal in eastern Tyr Farwyn will pay for lizard corpses (use 'present corpse')

--

Land of Anarchy is very dangerous

--

Shields offer protection from crits

Don't forget the ranger quests if you're a ranger

--

sit lap to get something from Santa

Skill first aid needs bandages

--

More information on first aid: http://www.bat.org/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t340.html

--

It's possible to use leather craft more than once at a corpse if first attempts fail

--

rip_action should just be "get all from corpse" if doing a lot of leather crafting or similar

--

rip_action has to be enabled after it is set, if previously off

--

The supervisor in the crystite mines is very dangerous

--

After one hunts down an animal with skill hunting and one has a fire going with fire building, one can cook the dead animal with cook (not a skill; just type cook and then the object)

--

[11:09]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: How far should I advance in the Ranger guild before taking on levels from any other guild?
[11:09]:Neclord (newbie): all the way i would say. Better to be good at one than bad at 2
[11:10]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: OK

--

It is possible to camp indoors but not to light fires indoors

--

XP in the crystite mine when you're at level 39 (last level allowed) is really pretty good,
especially at lower levels

--

[14:07]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: How good is crystite equipment really?
[14:08]:Mancomb [newbie]: It's actually pretty decent for lowbies!
[14:08]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Worth saving up for that psionic axe?
[14:08]:Mancomb [newbie]: Wouldn't farm the 20k-ish items, but the ones under 3k or so are well worth the time spent imo
[14:08]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Yeah thought so

--

help skill parry
Help available on topic:
Skill duration: random.
Type of skill : neutral skill.
Affecting stats: Str/Dex.
It uses no endurance points.
While most of the art of combat leans towards the offensive side, a portion of this art leans also in the defensive direction. If one has a weapon in hand, even better if he has a shield, he can use these to help deflect blows aimed at himself. The best way to live to fight another day, is not to die. Of course, if one is spending time defending himself, he may not attack with the same effectiveness as he would if he was not holding himself back in order to defend himself.

--

[15:14]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Is there any way you can detect what guilds someone is in?
[15:14]:Eronk (newbie): ginfo <name>

--

The Reaver in the town on level 2 of the Crystite Mine appears to have a fairly nice trident (for future reincs)

--

[15:05]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: How useful is plant lore for a Ranger?
[15:06]:Eronk (newbie): very, if you ask Tiktok
[15:07]:Eronk (newbie): I never trained it personally
[15:07]:Mancomb [newbie]: Herbal remedies are fairly nice? And you can also sell some of the flowers
[15:08]:Eronk (newbie): to my understanding, herbal remedies aren't worth it if you're collecting them from the overworld
[15:08]:Eronk (newbie): could just spend that time regenning regularly
[15:08]:Mancomb [newbie]: Probaly more efficient
[15:08]:Eronk (newbie): if you have a greenhouse, then it might be different

--

Outdoors Supply Co. in Ranger guild has some useful stuff

--

[15:17]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: How exactly does pathfinding work?
[15:19]:Eronk (newbie): you memorize a location with location memory, then you use pathfinding at the location and you move there
[15:19]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Ohhh
[15:20]:Eronk (newbie): it uses a bunch of ep so it's not MEGA useful
[15:20]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Doesn't fire / camping recuperate EP?
[15:20]:Eronk (newbie): yes
[15:20]:Eronk (newbie): some people do use the pathfinding so its not completely useless
[15:21]:Eronk (newbie): also if I remember correctly you had to memorize a overworld, non-scenic, location for it to work

--

[16:52]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Where can you sell plants?
[16:53]:Tiktok [newbie]: at the achemists guild ne of Lorenchia
[16:53]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Thx

--

look trashcan
This is a large, iron trashcan.
You can drop items you don't need in it.
To drop something in it type:    toss <object>
Only things with a value below 20 can be dropped in it.
As a thanks for using it you will receive up to 5 coins for each item tossed.
This item is in excellent condition.
It looks light weight.

[17:52]:Lyriikka (newbie): you can fly over them if you have a flying ship
[17:52]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Neat

Parry settings are not saved over reboots

Metal rods may sell as armor

[07:45]:Melco [newbie]: I hiope you can help me with a question regarding spellcasting. When I start a spell, but want to cancel it before it finishes, is there any way to do so save by moving from the room I am in?
[07:45]:Deathwish [newbie]: type zz
[07:45]:Melco [newbie]: thanks all
[07:45]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: That's even better
[07:45]:Eressa (newbie): yeah zz or cast stop

Aggressive monsters in Dah'bec are very dangerous

--

[12:30]:Melco [newbie]: How does the sauna cure poison?

[12:31]:Moor [newbie]: you heat it up and damage from poison is reduced but your ep drops

--

Ant Hill is dangerous

"climb tree" to enter the Catfolk Village

--

Use slots to see where you can still put equipment

--

[17:28]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Will I get regen gains from fire building if I keep adding more XP or should I just focus on mastery of fire building? Same question for camping
[17:29]:Grushnak [newbie]: My understanding is that both contribute. I'm not sure which contributes more
[17:29]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Ah OK
[17:29]:Nepos (newbie): Camping scales to %, not sure about fire building
[17:30]:Eronk (newbie): I'm under assumption mastery of fire building gives a static buff to fire with the chance of skill%
[17:30]:Eronk (newbie): +5 or so

--

[19:38]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: How do I get a room?
[19:38]:Saldas [newbie]: ask around on wanted, someone might be selling/giving out rooms

--

help rooms

My hall guard's name in Redwall is Ismail

--

[20:16]:Khwarizmi [party]: Did I secure the room properly?

[20:17]:Tiktok [party]: didn't check but I will
[20:17]:Khwarizmi [party]: How do I lock it?
[20:17]:Tiktok [party]: only closed
[20:17]:Tiktok [party]: door w locked

[20:20]:Tiktok [party]: combo on a chest is 0 0 0
[20:21]:Tiktok [party]: when you give it to someone

My chest combo is a familiar number, something personal about me ;)

[20:24]:Tiktok [party]: you have to close it then unlock it to pick it up

[23:11]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: How useful is find campsite?
[23:12]:Pharm (newbie): prolly not very useful nowadays
[23:12]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Figured
[23:12]:Rammon [newbie]: one might say it is very useless
[23:16]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: How much good is training, say, Attack past 100% (with bonuses)
[23:16]:Adus [newbie]: very
[23:16]:Hair the Helper (newbie): at low exp totals, not much
[23:16]:Hair the Helper (newbie): you get 1/4 benefit over 100%

[23:29]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Ship item?
[23:29]:Darna [newbie]: aren't they like radars?
[23:29]:Pharm (newbie): something like that.

--

Don't use single quotes when use plant lore (who knows why)

--

[23:36]:Adus [newbie]: any suggestion on non-dodging enemies to complete ranger push quest (I need 40 succesful pushes)
[23:36]:Adus [newbie]: in a row
[23:36]:Pharm (newbie): generally I have small mobs in newbiemountains for that task

--

Weight carried influences Dodge skill

The registration clerk in Arelium appears impossible to kill; don't try

(Apparently one needs access privilege to use a given greenhouse)

  beehive help                             - This help.

--

Moor [newbie]: close beehive
Moor [newbie]: Don't leave it open, keep it cleaned
Moor [newbie]: check the condition of the inserts
Moor [newbie]: go talk to sister Jennifer and buy needed supplies
Moor [newbie]: bees happen automatically if I remember correctly

--

It is vital to wear protective gear when dealing with beehives. (Whether a Minotaur needs a veil I'll have to find out...)

--

The Warlock Conclave can be dangerous; there are aggressive mobs in the far south and large numbers of rats can be surprisingly nasty when dealt with all at once

--

The High Priest of Rasha in Ancient Tower is *very* dangerous

--

Valley of Silence magic users also appear to be *very* dangerous

--

Sephrenia in Followers of Vanion is dangerous but is a glass cannon

--

The deer in Brimshire are good kills

--

The sewers of Calythien are easy to get lost in and maybe not worth it for a Ranger (because it's impossible to light a fire or camp in them). If I venture in there again I will be making an attempt to map the place.

--

Burning Village has good looting opportunities so close to Calythien

--

[00:22]:Kelzarath [newbie]: where can I store items?
[00:23]:Rabo [newbie]: usually, you carry stuff around with you. You can get a equipment frame to carry stuff on your back at reduced weight

--

Minotaurs only need to wear the gloves to harvest honey and wax from beehives! Yay!

--

(00:50) Endure tells you 'arelium grocery store buys the honey'
(00:50) Endure tells you 'wax is used in some merchant, alchemy and especially nun candmaking - if you can't dip into those skills the unrefined wax is mainly useless'

--

Wax can be left in honeycombs safely

--

Honey can be consumed for +str

--

On how long it takes honeycombs to fill up:

(02:00) Endure tells you 'depends on the condition'
(02:01) Endure tells you 'about 4-5 hours for full condition ones to harvest, and increasing amount of time from there on'

--

[02:10]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: If I reinc (not now) and want to join Riftwalkers, what's the best way to access the guild?
[02:12]:Roak {newbie}: with difficulty.
[02:12]:Endure the Helper [newbie]: race that can fly or swim would be optimal for your first time since you likely have to tread a bit of water
[02:12]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: DDDDD:
[02:12]:Roak {newbie}: entrance to guild is floating around lake northwest of shadowkeep on roth
[02:12]:Endure the Helper [newbie]: reading the maps and understanding where the guild actually might be would be useful
[02:12]:Endure the Helper [newbie]: I've helped people find it and they were completely off the course
[02:13]:Roak {newbie}: usually other rifters are helpful in finding it.
[02:13]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Would it make more sense to join mage guild first and progress until I get water walking? (Assuming mages have water walking)
[02:13]:Roak {newbie}: i'd do rifters first. just get it done. you'll find it.
[02:14]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: OK

--

Alternatively someone with a ship can transport player to Riftwalker guild

--

A lot of useful information here: http://www.megami.com/tag/batmud-guild/

--

The Ranger in Darkwood is no laughing matter

--

[05:59]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: What are these "essence" things anyhow?
[05:59]:Mesardus [newbie]: for making reinc potions
[05:59]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Should I collect them when I see them?
[05:59]:Mesardus [newbie]: yes worth 1-2k each

--

Giant carrots taken from mantises in the Cornfield can be sold at the Arelium grocery store

--

[23:12]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: What does it mean if a ring loses its blue glow?
[23:13]:Eronk (newbie): blue glow is protect armour/weapon

--

Acid is apparently the first specialty an aspiring Mage should join


[06:18]:Daerid {newbie}: mana's pretty decent too
[06:19]:Malcom (newbie): mana (magic) is good too
[06:19]:Bee [newbie]: What's lockbiter though
[06:20]:Malcom (newbie): help spell lock biter
[06:20]:Isam (newbie): psi also is nice for meditation and psionic shield makes you survive mob blasts a bit easier.

--

Don't toss essences or maps

--

Don't start a fight in the inn in the start of the Catfolk Tree zone; you'll get teleported

--

Mirkhold should be avoided for now because of the mobs that gang up on you

--

Don't attack the Magic Mouth in Shadowkeep

--

Don't go to Horn-Durath for now

--

Don't attack bridge guards in Catfolk Tree

--

One can sell stuff in the Duzleton General Store

--

XP opportunities in the Mirror Mine can be good notwithstanding the lack of a map and how it's not possible to get a fire going in the area

--

Avoid basilisks at all costs

--

Stay out of Stagira for now

--

Carrying a waterskin or canteen is really not necessary

--

If one has a large amount of honey, don't sell it all at once as this will result in diminished profit from the glut

--

Don't go in the cave in Digga's Domain

--

rip_action set get all from corpse; dig grave; get essence

--

Stay away from Mountain Dwarves; too many aggro mobs there

--

Dark Castle is pretty good

--

Navtrees are represented by a T on the map

--

Misty Forest is OK; just mind the alchemist at or near the top of the eastern building as he is very dangerous

--

First aid, an otherwise fairly useless skill, appears to be beneficial for make herbal remedy

--

Rumor has it that skill level of 75% is needed to include yarrow and/or ginseng in herbal remedies

--

Remember that eye of loraen can be trained on specific types of resources

--

Mudlet uses ISO-8859-15

--

The dark skeleton in Kath'vael Forest, while beatable, casts a bunch of annoying curses that take a while to wear off

--

The risk of fighting snow devils is really not worth it for now (POWERFUL magic)

--

Alcohol tolerance is not an important skill

--

After asking how to preserve parry settings over reboot:

[15:16]:Bulain [newbie]: Khwarizmi Maybe set a trigger based on the welcome message when you login to set parry?
[15:16]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: That's not a bad idea

--

Norse Cave is pointless at this juncture

--

Ruins of Unta'r Trinit seems too dangerous

--

Killing Felix in Norse Village doesn't appear to be worth the effort

--

Ice-cold water can be lethal

--

Forest in the Valley is a bretty gud location; just don't enter the dungeon

--

When posting in wanted about summoning, mention continent you're on

--

Kalevala has great opportunities for XP but beware the briar patch!!!

--

In parties, be in brave mode

--

Sell essences for 1.5k per and give amount in sales channel e.g. "10 essence 15k" 

--

Use count to count essences (or other items)

--

Remember to leave parties that are going on break

--

exp bonus pool
--------------
SHORT VERSION:
While you have an exp bonus pool, you are awarded more experience for doing the usual things. When it is depleted, you will get no bonus. 

LONG VERSION:
Here is a rough summary of the exp bonus pool which affects all players (with less than 300 million experience).

Your pool contains exp. Every time you gain some amount of experience, the same amount is reduced from the exp bonus pool. Part of the reduced exp is added to the exp gain. So, new players effectively get double exp, and people closer to 300 million worth will get a smaller bonus.

The exp bonus pool restores with time, up to a maximum of 900k. It is also possible to replenish the pool with taskpoints. For details on this, see 'help exp'.

--

There are a number of very useful navtrees around Arelium

--

wimpy should always be off

--

At Efiilas Advance Camp:

[03:02]:Malcom (party): ask elf about hard work
[03:02]:Malcom (party): then
[03:02]:Malcom (party): quote 'look at note' party report

--

Parry shouldn't be on in general, only in deftank situations or similar :(

--

I don't know yet whether it's possible to riposte with no points in parry but I can at least check the summary stats

--

p is short for party

--

Dexterity doesn't appear to have anything to do with price of items produced through leather crafting

--

Bank records do not show deposits from other players who paid you but the discrepancy will be seen in inventory

--

If you think you might get poisoned and don't have a cure close at hand, just don't do it

--

The enemies at the far north end of Plakhstan are very dangerous

--

Don't go into the tunnel in Perilous Forest and also beware the aggressive mobs

--

[07:33]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: When should I get surgery again?
[07:33]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Below 90 or below 80?
[07:33]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: I never saw it be a problem until like... below 50... but...
[07:33]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: get scars removed more regularly

--

High Priest of the Red Demon Cult in Kath'vael Forest inflicts scars

--

[07:48]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: What are the unique issues of scars
[07:49]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: a tarmalen should really be answering this, but, they increase the chance of ress fumble, and, I believe that is a separate issue to simply having low cha
[07:49]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: Let me be clear: you do NOT want a ress fumble.
[07:50]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: What happens after a ress fumble
[07:51]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: As far as I know, you can lose stats that can't be recovered until you reinc.  I don't believe a potion of int restoring or such fixes that, but I could be wrong
[07:51]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: I also seem to recall there are other issues but... I'm not comfortable commenting on that, I am just not sure
[07:52]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: also, sometimes ress fumbles do nothing.  It is not certain.  Extra aging is also a thing.
[07:53]:Malcom (newbie):  fumbled ress/rais/body is often cause by low cha and/ or scars
[07:53]:Malcom (newbie): fumbles can result in stat loss, level loss, loss of exp, probably other bad stuff i'm forgetting
[07:53]:Glamdring (newbie): and level difference between caster and ressable
[07:54]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: DDDDD:
[07:54]:Malcom (newbie): stats and exp to both parties involved i think.  levels to castee
[07:54]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: it is the fate worse than death in batmud.

--

Scars can be seen by "look me"

--

Stay away from Horsehead Mountain for now

--

Donaru is a great place for XP

--

Don't attack the shopkeeper in Arelium for now

--

To join the Barbarian guild after having a lot of experience, go to Digga's, then Raven.

"In Raven jail, kill jailkeeper to get key.  Unlock cell, open cell, enter cell. This frees Groo, the son of the Barbarian Chieftain.  Groo will give you the Barbarian Ring of Friendship in thanks for his freedom."

--

After getting the ring, go south down the path and do "search bushes" at A Turn in the Path. One can enter. Then "show ring". Then find Bankha and "join".

--

"barbarian binfo <your username>" to see your own Barbarian reputation

--

Corpses have to be totally immolated to count towards Barbarian reputation

--

If your Barbarian reputation appears full then it's capped; cap is raised (+300) with each level and goes away entirely at guild level 20

--

(18:28) Mancomb tells you 'Just to give you an idea - I've been in barb guild for a month now and gained 2350 rep. You need 50 000 to be considered a 'repbarb' who can stun reliably'

--

[15:37]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: How do I know whether a piece of a map is worth anything
[15:38]:Stalgrad (newbie): at the bottom it'll say something like 'shows the location of a possible site' if it's good, or ' shows the location of an already looted site' if it's useless
[15:38]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: It is a piece of leather that has some sort of a map drawn on it. The label can be set with 'label' command. This item is in good condition. It looks light weight.
[15:38]:Stalgrad (newbie): read map?
[15:39]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Ah

--

Apparently maps of value run from 20k-50k typically. Maybe try a minimum bid. (40k seems fairly common?)

--

Shadowkeep General Store owner does identification (to some extent at least)

--

Hell's Dojo is good for exp

--

(20:25) Savu tells you 'I always set [Parry] to either 0 or 51 (the opposite maximums). At zero, parry is not on at all and my offensive power is at maximum. At 51, I am on defensive mode and my defenses are at max (I parry, and with riposte skill trained, some of the parries result in a low power counterattack which compensates the loss of damage due to parrying a bit). Of course it's best to try it yourself, but I've found this strategy working the best for me.'
(20:28) Savu tells you 'For example if I am in a situation where I am getting a lot of damage from hits, parry can help you get that critical attack skill in just in time before having to bail out. Or if there are multiple opponents, I set my target at one opponent at a time with my parry at 51 and use skill only at that one target. That way my offensive power is focused on one single target at a time and my parry protects me a bit from the others while I take out one by one.'

--

[20:37]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Remind me if rep gains from burning corpses are dependent on difficulty of mob?
[20:37]:Sumendar [newbie]: yes

ra set get all from corpse; get essence; barbburn

--

Keep torches to avoid tossing them

[21:34]:Marrow (newbie): . = 1 , : = 2
[21:34]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: and the #?
[21:34]:Marrow (newbie): # = 10
[21:34]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Ah
[21:34]:Marrow (newbie): no wait
[21:34]:Marrow (newbie): : = 10
[21:34]:Marrow (newbie): # = 100
[21:34]:Marrow (newbie): @ = 1000
[21:35]:Marrow (newbie): X = 10000
[21:35]:Hair the Helper (newbie): . is 1 : is 10 # is 100 @ is 1000 X is 10000

--

[21:42]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Can I make it to 50,000 rep with looting and burning alone?
[21:43]:Pharm (newbie): prolly, but that take TIME
[21:43]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: DDDDD:
[21:44]:Loerhei [newbie]: whats the other way barbs gain their rep?
[21:44]:Ergor (newbie): but can be done

--

More Barbarian info: http://www.anvianet.fi/moonlord/batmud/barbarian.html

[19:18]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Cool
[19:18]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: What do they usually go for?
[19:18]:Eronk (newbie): I didnt exactly mean there will be someone to buy it, but it's possible
[19:18]:Mancomb [newbie]: try broker and batwiki sales search to give you an idea

--

Skill in kick and push appears relevant to bladed fury!

--

Arelium has a ring shop that sells rings of infravision for races without it

--

Main merchant cube locations appear to be Esiris, Arelium, Southern Crossing and Dortlewall

--

Coffee Forest is a good midbie area

--

Look at beehive to see whether honeycombs are full

--

Don't sell too much honey at once; you'll glut the market

--

Running to Vlad and asking for remove poison on wanted may work

--

[21:15]:Khwarizmi [newbie]: Do I have a better chance of finding barberries with higher eye of loraen?

[04:01]:Samadate [newbie]: when i use hunting and cook or eat outright the animal, i get a ? in 
affects, does this ever become a known effect?
[04:01]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: it does for me, not sure what the deal is
[04:02]:Hair the Helper (newbie): might be based on your 'cooking' skill percentage.  You can go down the rabbit hole that is cooking by finding Teapot in the city of Arelium and give him some food item
[04:02]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: it really is a rabbit hole
[04:03]:Rabo [newbie]: foods can give different effects like bonuses, if thats what your asking
[04:04]:Samadate [newbie]: so learn to cook, and understand the magic behind the gourmet.
[04:05]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: you can't.  At least not for the basic stuff.  It makes no sense.
[04:05]:Rabo [newbie]: hmm wasnt suggesting that :)
[04:05]:Hair the Helper (newbie): once you are proficient enough at cooking you can start learning 'master chef' where you really can make targetted foods for various stats
[04:05]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: yesterday I sauteed a sauage, a piece of bread and a watermlon push up and made a cooked squirrel.
[04:05]:Nyriori the Helper [newbie]: I rest my case.

[16:14]:Eschaton [newbie]: la guard on ground? dunno if that works
[16:14]:Malos (newbie): it does

--

[20:38]:Moonglaze (bat): the rep carries on to next levels, just not available until the next level
[20:38]:Hair (bat): you should set your sights on making barb elder instead, that way if you reinc back to barb you don't lose any rep
[20:38]:Khwarizmi [bat]: Oh neat

--

Ore can be processed in the Mirror Mine (gnome wing)

--
