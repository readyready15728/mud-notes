There are 8 classes in the Mud; 
Mage, Esper, Gypsy, Hunter, Warrior, Thief, Priest, Ranger.

Roughly they can be divided into three subtypes:
Rogue Classes           =  Gypsy, Thief, Ranger
Spell Casting Classes   =  Esper, Priest, Mage
Fighter Classes         =  Hunter, Warrior

Here you can choose a subtype to play as until level 20.
At that point you can choose the specific class you wish to be.

--

The SPELLCASTING CLASSES are lousy with a weapon, since 
they need to concentrate and have both hands free to cast their 
spells. If they are bare handed, they have a default magic attack, 
which depending on their level, tier, and also some skills or 
equipment can become faster and more powerful.
They also use ORBS and STAVES to enhance their magic. 
The skill MANIFEST creates an ORB from an existing weapon. 
A Staff, which is more powerful, has to be created by the 
skill WOODSING  but not by the mages themselves.
Mage/Priest/Esper classes will like +int +cha +hp items.

Are you sure you want to be a Caster (Yes/No)?

ELVES from the lost fantasy world of Medieval time, have the stature of Man,
but are not as strong or enduring.  Being an ancient race, far older than 
Man, ELVES have a much deeper wisdom and intelligence however. Elves are
the best race for spellcasting.

We think we have a rather unique Mud, and you may find it quite a bit different 
from other Muds you have played.
Don't despair! Just read the descriptions and the signs in the introduction 
area, and you'll catch up rapidly. 4D is a very newbie friendly Mud.
We have a unique Mudschool, which provides an easy introduction to the world of 
4D, and also a Quest Academy that introduces you to our special Quest culture. 
On our website are several MAPS which will make orientation a bit easier once 
you venture out into our large main world.
Type DOWN in order to get to the next room.  
But first maybe you'd better read the SIGN that is hovering mysteriously in 
the air before you. Type look sign or read sign to read it.

--

Type HELP or HELP <subject> to get to our Helpfiles.
If you have any questions, use the command newbie <message> to ask. 
Hopefully some of the players will respond.
The players with a HELPER sign in their title should be particularly helpful
in this. You can also send a direct tell to any of them with the command 
tell <player-name> <message>.
Are you BLIND or sightly impared? Type help 796 to see the options we offer.

--

What makes our mud unique is that we have four sections to explore.  You can go
to the Old West and track down such bandits as Billy The Kid or Jesse James.  
Another adventure would be in the Prehistoric age, mostly set around the
Mediterranean Sea around 2000 BC.  Or enter your spaceship and face the 
adventures of distant Galaxies in our futuristic section.  And, last, but far 
from least, sit at the Round Table with King Arthur and his knights in our 
Medieval section.  
Type DOWN to get to Mud School, where you will learn the basics about 
how to get along in the game.
But first maybe you'd better read the SIGN that is hovering mysteriously in 
the air before you.

The tabard you're wearing as a crest is a very useful object.

115H 1000M 1002V (100) 1,119TNL>

Don't use it just yet, just look at it, to see what it can do.
 This is the Clan Crest of the Mighty Seeker's Guild!
 Every clan in 4D gets a crest that can be worn to represent one's clan.
 This crest in particular has several commands linked to it.
 
 There are certain tasks that should be completed while moving through
 the mud school and newbie zones thereafter.  To access these tasks
 simply type TASKS.
 
 To get to Recall Point, type RECALL.
 To get back to the 4D School, type SCHOOL.
 To get to the Seeker's Guild, type CLANHALL.
 
 The crest also has the ability to turn the HINT channel on and off, and also
 adjust its frequency.
 These hints will broadcast approximately every 5 minutes by default.

 To turn on this channel simply type HINT ON
 To turn off this channel, simply type HINT OFF
 To control the frequency, simply type HINT <frequency>.
 For example, type HINT 10 if you want to hear these hints every 10 minutes.

 Lastly, type LOOK MISSION to get a full Mission briefing of your newbie tasks.

--

So - you don't think of yourself as a newbie? Very well, it is your choice,
even if this mud might be quite a bit different from others that you may have
played. Anyway, here is some advice for you:
- There is a Donation pit under the Place of Recall, which is in the south 
  end of Adventure Avenue. In it you may - or you may not - find some equip
  donated by other players. If you are lucky it may be very good too.
- There are 4 newbie zones for the levels 1-10, situated on both sides of
  Venture Way, west of Gordy the Greeter. There are no aggro mobs in those, 
  and the mobs are between level 1 and 10, so consider before you attack.
- Mud School here is NOT the usual stock School, it's a zone, containing some
  rather good equip, plenty of mobs between level 1 and 4 for you to kill, 
  several easy Quests and - above all - some useful information about this 
  mud. And be sure not to miss the Quest Academy at the top.
- Gordy the Greeter will send you to different places on request. Just 
  SAY Recall, Library, School or Venture
- The 4D Travelling Agency south of Recall can give you other valuable 
  information. The same goes for the Seeker's Library.
But you don't want info, right? You want to get killed right ahead? 
O.K. - type "wear all", "wield <weapon-name>" and have Gordy transport you.

To get a better knowledge of yourself you can type 'score' which will give
you some knowledge of who you are. At this low level you only get limited
information. As you rise in the levels, you will get more and more info.
 
The most important thing you need to know is your exact health condition.
This is shown in the three numbers: 
 
H (hitpoints), M (mana), V (move), (Stamina), Exp needed to level.
For instance: 3000H 2230M 957V (100) 504,930,692TNL>
 
If your prompt for some reason doesn't look like this, type 'prompt all' to
set it up now. After you leave 4D School you can go to the room west of
Recall Point and on the bulletin board there you will find many other things you
can add to your prompt to your liking. Or type HELP PROMPTCODES right now.

--

The trainer in this room will help you practice your skills/spells, to improve
abilities.  You enter this World with a set of abilities (usually called STATS)
that are partly dependent on what race and class you have chosen.  Your stats
are strength (str), wisdom (wis), intelligence (int), constitution (con),
charisma (cha), dexterity (dex), hitpoints (hp), mana and move.  You lose hp
when you receive damage in a fight, mana when you use magic and move points when
you move about.  You also get a set of skills and spells that you will be able
to practice, at certain levels.  It might be a good idea to check them now,
before you proceed into the harsh outside world.  So type look sign to
learn a bit more about practicing.  And while you are at it, type look box
and look in box too.  
A large box stands in the corner of the room.
A lantern spreads a dim light here. ...it is glowing with an inner light
A pair of deerskin moccasins have been left here.
|[T] Lionel, the famous Knight is here to help you practice your skills.
...he glows with a bright light!

115H 1000M 1001V (100) 1,119TNL>

Lionel tells you, 'Welcome to 4D School, Khwarizmi!'
Lionel tells you, 'You'd better get the equipment in the box.'
Lionel tells you, 'You're going to need it in this harsh world.'

115H 1000M 1001V (100) 1,119TNL>

Lionel tells you, 'I can teach you to practice your first skills too.'
Lionel tells you, 'type PRACT, to see what you've got.'
Lionel tells you, 'If you are a Caster, you definitely need to practice Manifest.'
Lionel tells you, 'To see what it does, type HELP MANIFEST and HELP ORB.'

115H 1000M 1002V (100) 1,119TNL>

Lionel tells you, 'Also, before you go... There is a useful command for you to use while going 
through 4D School, called TASKS. '
Simply type TASKS and it will let you know what you need to accomplish within the School itself, the 
Quest Academy, and the Newbie zones following it.

--

You can use your practice points to practice your skills/spells. (The skills 
you get are based on what CLASS you've chosen and what LEVEL you are).
Type pract to see how many practice points you've got and the skills/spells 
you can practice at different levels. 
Type pract <skill/spell-name> to practice a particular skill/spell. (for 
instance pract mount)
Maybe at this low level you can't practice anything yet? Don't worry, you
can always come back to this room again. There are also many Trainers and 
Guildmasters all over the Realms who will help you practice later. In fact,
finding the right Trainer for a certain skill or spell might be a bit of a
Quest, because the Guildmasters and Clan Trainers only teach the most common
skills and spells, the rest are taught by various specialists.
As you can see, Lionel here has a [T] in front of his name. That is the way 
you can identify a Trainer anywhere in the game. All of them will be marked 
with the same [T]. 
To learn more about classes and skills, type HELP CLASSES.
To view what skills the different Classes get, type SKILLLIST <CLASS>.
(And yes, it's spelled with three Ls, just like that).

--

This is what is called a Newbie box. The equipment in it is quite good, so 
you'd better get it and wear it. Type `get all box' to get all in the box.
Type `wear all' to wear your new equipment. Type `look box' to
look at the box itself. Type `look in box' to see what's in the box.

--

You are about to enter the school that will teach you about the different
Dimensions of this world of ours, and show you how to do many different things
here.  From basic mechanics, to socializing, to combat, it's all here in the Mud
School.  For your first 10 levels here in 4D, there is no death penalty.  The
Gods will revive you.  You will be sent to a place where you will be healed.  
Once there just enter the rift and you will be at the Recall point.  To get back
to here from Recall, just head all the way north, say 'please' at the gate, and
keep going north.  But remember, that's only till level 10.  After that dying is
a bit trickier.  You will have to return to your corpse to get your stuff back,
or wait for it to automeld.
You can come back to newbie school any time till you are level 50.

--

After finishing each Grade of 4D School you have a free choice if you want to
skip one stage and go on directly to a higher Grade.  You can also type 'down'
to drop out of School entirely, in case you get bored and want to try the Game a
bit before proceeding.  There is always the chance to come back later and finish
your education.  Only remember - once you are past level 50, you will no longer
be permitted to enter 4D School.  Now type east to go to the next station.

If you type look around, you will see some information about the zone you
are in.  It shows the name, the level range, and the average of all the mobs
that are in the zone.  These numbers are 'realtime' basically meaning that if
somebody kills all the top level mobs, they won't show up on the range till they
reset.

--

They say that one person's trash is another person's treasure.  Well this can
actually be true here in 4 dimensions.  There are some people who understand
this, so instead of throwing away what they don't want, they sometimes donate 
it. This man is here hoping to find some rare treasures that other people didn't
want.  Why not say "hello" to him? Who knows, maybe he has some trash you
could find useful.
An old man is in excellent condition.

--

As you already have noticed, you move around by just typing the direction in 
which you want to go. There are six directions in which you can normally leave 
a room; north, east, south, west, up and down, (use n, e, s, w, u and d as 
abbreviations). Some rooms have all these exits, some have only a few, some 
have none at all. And some exits are doors, that can be closed or locked. A
closed door doesn't show up in the room desc; you have to look or walk in that 
direction to see it. 
The command EXITS lists all exits and the room they lead to.
The command MAP gives a small map of the closest surroundings in 'normal' zones.
If you are in a 'Wilderness' zone the map will be bigger, 11 x 11 rooms.
Some exits are one way exits, meaning you can't get back to the room you just 
came from. As you can see there is no exit west here leading back to the lake 
you came from. The exit going north leads to the next station of 4D School. 
Type 'north' (or 'n') to get there.

--

- To refresh what a room looks like: type 'look'. 
  This brings back the original room description.
- To look at an object or a person: type 'look <item-name>' or 'look <char-
  name>' 
- You can also sometimes look at nouns in a room description. 
Looking at things will in most cases give you a closer description of the 
object or the person. Sometimes it will give you VERY valuable information, 
perhaps about a hidden object or a Quest. 
You can also LISTEN and SMELL in a room, by just using those commands. In some 
cases, but not often, this too might give you some valuable information.

--

Some objects are very useful and you can pick them up and utilize them in 
different ways, for instance as weapons and armour. If you look at the 
objects in this room, you will get some more information about what to 
do with them. 
- Type 'get <item>'  to pick up an item from the ground. 
- Type 'get all'     to get every loose item there is in the room.
- Type 'get <item> <container>'  to get an item from a container. 
- Type 'get all <container>' to get everything inside a container.
- Type 'drop <item>' to drop an item. 
- Type 'drop all'    to drop all items you are carrying. 
- Type 'look <item>' (for instance 'look flintstone') to look at an object.
You can't get all items you see. For instance the large stone you see on the 
ground would be much too heavy for you to lift.
Sometimes you can't pick an item up, because you already are carrying too 
much. In this case you need to first drop something to be able to get the new 
thing. It's generally a good rule not to drag too many things around, especially
since how much you carry will affect your speed. You will learn more about speed
further on in 4D School.
Now get what you can from the burrow, by typing GET ALL BURROW.
Then look at the things to decide what is worth keeping.
Drop the rest and go east.

--

In the sunny glen several small animals are scampering happily around, feeding
from the lush grass.  They look very cute too - furry, fuzzy little things...
But this is the Stone Age, and the main rule here is "Kill or be killed" - "Eat
or be eaten".  So maybe this would be a convenient opportunity to make your
first experience as a hunter?  All these small animals look like they'd be an
easy kill, don't they?  All you have to do is to type 'kill <mob-name>'(for
instance 'kill rabbit').  But first of all, read the sign that is
floating mysteriously in the air.  Then kill all the animals you see here, it
will help you to survive in the future.  After you have done this go east.

--

Actually those small animals aren't QUITE as easy to kill as they look, unless 
you get a bit tricky and use a nice hard hitting attack on them.
1.  Did you get those things behind the stone to the west?
2.  If so, type WEAR ALL, REM <WEAPON NAME> and WIELD SLIVER (the sliver is a better
    weapon than the dagger).
If you are a Mage, Esper, or Priest of course you will want to MANIFEST the 
sliver and then WEAR it.
3.  After you killed one animal check the hitpoints on your prompt. If it is 
    low you must recover before you attack the next animal. This will only 
    take a few seconds. If you attack before being fully recovered, the next 
    animal will probably kill you.
- There is also a command called NOBAT that you can use. This toggle will
brief many things that you see. Its main use is to cut down on spam that
fighting can cause. When you have nobat on, you will only see yourself
being hit, and the hits that you are inflicting. Also, if you have nobat
on, you will not see other people fighting.
To use this command, just type NOBAT. To turn it back off/on, type NOBAT
again. There are many other toggles available to you as well. To view the
list of them, type TOGGLE.

--

When you have been moving around a bit, your move-points get lower. When you 
have been engaged in a fight your hitpoints decrease. You can check your 
current stats by typing SCORE. This will show you two sets of figures for each 
of the stats hp, mana and move. If the right one is a bit lower than the left, 
you'd better wait till you have regenerated before moving on to the next room. 
You'll regenerate quicker if you type REST or SLEEP. Sleep is the fastest 
way, but it also shuts you off from what's going on in the game, and exposes 
you to the attacks of some cowardly mobs that only attack sleeping players. 
So you should always be a bit cautious of WHERE you fall asleep. This room 
is quite safe, however, so it would be OK to do it here. When you feel rested 
enough, type first WAKE, then STAND to get on your feet again. Then go east.

--

To DRINK from this creek or from a fountain just type 'drink creek' or 'drink 
water'. There are also drink-containers that you can carry with you, to be 
able to drink at all times. You already have one of those hopefully, the 
waterskin. In case you lost it, the birch bark cup that somebody hopefully left 
here for you, is another such drink-container. To drink from it you have to 
pick it up first ('get cup'). You can fill the drink-container with water by 
typing 'fill cup' or 'fill skin' every time you get to a creek, a well or a 
fountain. 
Then type 'drink cup' or 'drink skin' to drink from it. 
To EAT just type 'eat <food>' (in this case 'eat flesh' or 'eat berries'). You 
can often find food to collect here and there in the world. There are also 
stores selling food and drink-containers. 
You can also sample food and drinks by typing 'sample food/drink>'.
You don't DIE from not eating and drinking regularly, but it affects your regen
rate negatively, if you are hungry and thirsty.

--

Equipment check time! Type EQUIPMENT to see your current equipment. If you 
just entered the Mud for the first time, you probably do not have much.
To see all the positions that you can wear equipment on type: EQ ALL
As you go through 4D School you'll be able to collect some more equipment. 
To wear a piece of armor:       type WEAR <item > (for instance `wear vest')
To light a light source:        type HOLD <item > (for instance `hold banner')
To wield a weapon:              type WIELD <weapon> for instance 'wield sword'.
To manifest a weapon to an orb: type first MANIFEST <weapon>, then WEAR <orb>
To wear all the armor you have:                      type WEAR ALL.
To use a magical item like a wand, scroll or staff:  type HOLD  <item>
To stop using a piece of equipment:                  type REM(OVE) <item>
To put all loose things into your backpack           type put all backpack
To get them out again                                type get all backpack
or, to get a single item out                         type GET <item> BACKPACK
Finally, to see the items in your inventory:         type INVENTORY.

--

Looking at a mob will sometimes give you some clue about its strength.  But a
much safer way is to "consider" the mob before you attack.  To do this you type
'con <mob-name>', (in this case 'con bear' and 'con salmon') and the answer you
get should give you an idea of what to expect.  As you gather some really good
equipment later, you will be able to take on mobs that would normally massacre
a player of your level.  But right now you'd better heed those messages you
get.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you easily.  Now 'con' the bear
and the salmon in this room. The bear won't harm you unless you attack it. So 
kill the salmon, but stay away from the bear unless you have a strong death 
wish! Then go east to cross the brook.

--

In this dangerous world you'll be wise to look a bit ahead, before you step
into the next peril.  You do this by typing 'look <direction>' (for instance
'look south').  This will give you some - usually very brief - information 
about what the room you are about to enter looks like.  But it will also tell 
you if there are any 'Mobs' waiting for you in that direction, and how far 
away they are.  Using the commands LISTEN and SMELL might give additional 
information.
Now type 'look west', 'look south' and 'look north' to test it.  Then go
south.  (It will be pretty safe if you just follow the instructions!)

--

The third killing lesson is running away. This female cave bear is way too 
strong for you to kill, but she won't have time to kill YOU if you run away 
fast enough. So try it out by typing 'cons bear', and then 'kill bear'. After 
a second or two, type 'flee' to escape from her. 
You can also set your char to flee automatically with the WIMPY command. 
(For instance type 'wimpy 10'). This will make you flee automatically when 
your hp goes down to 10. Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about WIMPY.
Remember, don't fight her to the finish!  Just type 'KILL BEAR', then when you 
are fighting, type FLEE, and repeat it until you flee and are out of here. 
After you flee, you will be back on the ledge you just left. Maybe you had 
better rest a bit after the fight? When you feel ready to go on to the next 
station, go NORTH.

--

Usually you gather your equipment by killing mobs that you encounter on your 
travels. The woman and child here each have something that could be useful 
for you. The easy way to get it is of course to kill them. 
But then again - killing isn't always the best choice...
However, if you decide to kill them, get all the equipment from the corpse 
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'. If there are more than one corpse in the 
same room, use 'GET ALL 2.CORPSE' etc. You can make your char do these things 
automatically by typing 'autoloot' and 'autogold', which might be a good idea
to do at this stage. Then use the command 'WEAR ALL' to wear your newly won 
equipment. 
You can also sacrifice items that you don't want to keep to the gods. To do 
this, first drop the item, then type 'SAC <item>'. This will earn you a small 
reward in gold, and also helps to keep the World clean. Another way to get rid
of an item in your inventory is the command 'JUNK <item>'. 
After you are through with the loot go east to the next station.
