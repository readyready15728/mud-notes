The SPELLCASTING CLASSES are lousy with a weapon, since 
they need to concentrate and have both hands free to cast their 
spells. If they are bare handed, they have a default magic attack, 
which depending on their level, tier, and also some skills or 
equipment can become faster and more powerful.
They also use ORBS and STAVES to enhance their magic. 
The skill MANIFEST creates an ORB from an existing weapon. 
A Staff, which is more powerful, has to be created by the 
skill WOODSING  but not by the mages themselves.
Mage/Priest/Esper classes will like +int +cha +hp items.

This is a Time Travel MUD, with over 140 all original zones (70000+ rooms)
and over 100 built-in Quests in the zones. We also have a customized MUD
School with a unique Quest Academy, where you can learn some good tricks.
If you are new to the game type HELP NEW; if you are new to mudding altogether
type HELP HELP or HELP <TOPIC>. If you notice any BUGs or TYPOs, please report

                           ***Naming Policy***
Choosing a name is an important part of your experience here. We have four
different dimensions, so the ranges for names is very broad. However, there
are some rules to choosing a name. Names of mobs, profanity, racial, religious,
and sexual slurs are not acceptable. Names like Asdfjkl, Hotbeef, Scottyiscool,
Dodgetheduck, etc., are not acceptable. Please choose wisely or you will be
told to change your name.
================================================================================
DISCLAIMER: Some of the zones in this mud contain certain things that can
be described as 'adult', and the language on the open channels is sometimes a
bit free too. So if you are very young, very sensitive or very prudish; maybe
you should find yourself another mud to play? :-)
================================================================================

However; don't use this disclaimer as an excuse to act like a moron on 
open channels. We expect our players to be mature enough to handle the
freedom we give them.

Remember that as a magic capable class, you don't need to wield
any weapon, your own raw magic with an orb or staff is enough in any battle.

So - you don't think of yourself as a newbie? Very well, it is your choice,
even if this mud might be quite a bit different from others that you may have
played. Anyway, here is some advice for you:
- There is a Donation pit under the Place of Recall, which is in the south 
  end of Adventure Avenue. In it you may - or you may not - find some equip
  donated by other players. If you are lucky it may be very good too.
- There are 4 newbie zones for the levels 1-10, situated on both sides of
  Venture Way, west of Gordy the Greeter. There are no aggro mobs in those, 
  and the mobs are between level 1 and 10, so consider before you attack.
- Mud School here is NOT the usual stock School, it's a zone, containing some
  rather good equip, plenty of mobs between level 1 and 4 for you to kill, 
  several easy Quests and - above all - some useful information about this 
  mud. And be sure not to miss the Quest Academy at the top.
- Gordy the Greeter will send you to different places on request. Just 
  SAY Recall, Library, School or Venture
- The 4D Travelling Agency south of Recall can give you other valuable 
  information. The same goes for the Seeker's Library.
But you don't want info, right? You want to get killed right ahead? 
O.K. - type "wear all", "wield <weapon-name>" and have Gordy transport you.

The Start Of 4D School
[ Exits: e s ]
You are about to enter the school that will teach you about the different
Dimensions of this world of ours, and show you how to do many different things
here.  From basic mechanics, to socializing, to combat, it's all here in the Mud
School.  For your first 10 levels here in 4D, there is no death penalty.  The
Gods will revive you.  You will be sent to a place where you will be healed.  
Once there just enter the rift and you will be at the Recall point.  To get back
to here from Recall, just head all the way north, say 'please' at the gate, and
keep going north.  But remember, that's only till level 10.  After that dying is
a bit trickier.  You will have to return to your corpse to get your stuff back,
or wait for it to automeld.
You can come back to newbie school any time till you are level 50.
There's a sign on the wall. Type LOOK SIGN to read it.
 An old man sits before you, sifting through junk on the floor.

--

look sign
After finishing each Grade of 4D School you have a free choice if you want to
skip one stage and go on directly to a higher Grade.  You can also type 'down'
to drop out of School entirely, in case you get bored and want to try the Game a
bit before proceeding.  There is always the chance to come back later and finish
your education.  Only remember - once you are past level 50, you will no longer
be permitted to enter 4D School.  Now type east to go to the next station.

If you type look around, you will see some information about the zone you
are in.  It shows the name, the level range, and the average of all the mobs
that are in the zone.  These numbers are 'realtime' basically meaning that if
somebody kills all the top level mobs, they won't show up on the range till they
reset.

--

look sign
As you already have noticed, you move around by just typing the direction in 
which you want to go. There are six directions in which you can normally leave 
a room; north, east, south, west, up and down, (use n, e, s, w, u and d as 
abbreviations). Some rooms have all these exits, some have only a few, some 
have none at all. And some exits are doors, that can be closed or locked. A
closed door doesn't show up in the room desc; you have to look or walk in that 
direction to see it. 
The command EXITS lists all exits and the room they lead to.
The command MAP gives a small map of the closest surroundings in 'normal' zones.
If you are in a 'Wilderness' zone the map will be bigger, 11 x 11 rooms.
Some exits are one way exits, meaning you can't get back to the room you just 
came from. As you can see there is no exit west here leading back to the lake 
you came from. The exit going north leads to the next station of 4D School. 
Type 'north' (or 'n') to get there.

--

look sign
You fade into view.
- To refresh what a room looks like: type 'look'. 
  This brings back the original room description.
- To look at an object or a person: type 'look <item-name>' or 'look <char-
  name>' 
- You can also sometimes look at nouns in a room description. 
Looking at things will in most cases give you a closer description of the 
object or the person. Sometimes it will give you VERY valuable information, 
perhaps about a hidden object or a Quest. 
You can also LISTEN and SMELL in a room, by just using those commands. In some 
cases, but not often, this too might give you some valuable information.

--

look sign
Actually those small animals aren't QUITE as easy to kill as they look, unless 
you get a bit tricky and use a nice hard hitting attack on them.
1.  Did you get those things behind the stone to the west?
2.  If so, type WEAR ALL, REM <WEAPON NAME> and WIELD SLIVER (the sliver is a better
    weapon than the dagger).
If you are a Mage, Esper, or Priest of course you will want to MANIFEST the 
sliver and then WEAR it.
3.  After you killed one animal check the hitpoints on your prompt. If it is 
    low you must recover before you attack the next animal. This will only 
    take a few seconds. If you attack before being fully recovered, the next 
    animal will probably kill you.
- There is also a command called NOBAT that you can use. This toggle will
brief many things that you see. Its main use is to cut down on spam that
fighting can cause. When you have nobat on, you will only see yourself
being hit, and the hits that you are inflicting. Also, if you have nobat
on, you will not see other people fighting.
To use this command, just type NOBAT. To turn it back off/on, type NOBAT
again. There are many other toggles available to you as well. To view the
list of them, type TOGGLE.

--

look sign
When you have been moving around a bit, your move-points get lower. When you 
have been engaged in a fight your hitpoints decrease. You can check your 
current stats by typing SCORE. This will show you two sets of figures for each 
of the stats hp, mana and move. If the right one is a bit lower than the left, 
you'd better wait till you have regenerated before moving on to the next room. 
You'll regenerate quicker if you type REST or SLEEP. Sleep is the fastest 
way, but it also shuts you off from what's going on in the game, and exposes 
you to the attacks of some cowardly mobs that only attack sleeping players. 
So you should always be a bit cautious of WHERE you fall asleep. This room 
is quite safe, however, so it would be OK to do it here. When you feel rested 
enough, type first WAKE, then STAND to get on your feet again. Then go east.

--

look sign
Equipment check time! Type EQUIPMENT to see your current equipment. If you 
just entered the Mud for the first time, you probably do not have much.
To see all the positions that you can wear equipment on type: EQ ALL
As you go through 4D School you'll be able to collect some more equipment. 
To wear a piece of armor:       type WEAR <item > (for instance `wear vest')
To light a light source:        type HOLD <item > (for instance `hold banner')
To wield a weapon:              type WIELD <weapon> for instance 'wield sword'.
To manifest a weapon to an orb: type first MANIFEST <weapon>, then WEAR <orb>
To wear all the armor you have:                      type WEAR ALL.
To use a magical item like a wand, scroll or staff:  type HOLD  <item>
To stop using a piece of equipment:                  type REM(OVE) <item>
To put all loose things into your backpack           type put all backpack
To get them out again                                type get all backpack
or, to get a single item out                         type GET <item> BACKPACK
Finally, to see the items in your inventory:         type INVENTORY.

--

look sign
In this dangerous world you'll be wise to look a bit ahead, before you step
into the next peril.  You do this by typing 'look <direction>' (for instance
'look south').  This will give you some - usually very brief - information 
about what the room you are about to enter looks like.  But it will also tell 
you if there are any 'Mobs' waiting for you in that direction, and how far 
away they are.  Using the commands LISTEN and SMELL might give additional 
information.
Now type 'look west', 'look south' and 'look north' to test it.  Then go
south.  (It will be pretty safe if you just follow the instructions!)

--

look sign
The third killing lesson is running away. This female cave bear is way too 
strong for you to kill, but she won't have time to kill YOU if you run away 
fast enough. So try it out by typing 'cons bear', and then 'kill bear'. After 
a second or two, type 'flee' to escape from her. 
You can also set your char to flee automatically with the WIMPY command. 
(For instance type 'wimpy 10'). This will make you flee automatically when 
your hp goes down to 10. Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about WIMPY.
Remember, don't fight her to the finish!  Just type 'KILL BEAR', then when you 
are fighting, type FLEE, and repeat it until you flee and are out of here. 
After you flee, you will be back on the ledge you just left. Maybe you had 
better rest a bit after the fight? When you feel ready to go on to the next 
station, go NORTH.

--

look sign
Usually you gather your equipment by killing mobs that you encounter on your 
travels. The woman and child here each have something that could be useful 
for you. The easy way to get it is of course to kill them. 
But then again - killing isn't always the best choice...
However, if you decide to kill them, get all the equipment from the corpse 
with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'. If there are more than one corpse in the 
same room, use 'GET ALL 2.CORPSE' etc. You can make your char do these things 
automatically by typing 'autoloot' and 'autogold', which might be a good idea
to do at this stage. Then use the command 'WEAR ALL' to wear your newly won 
equipment. 
You can also sacrifice items that you don't want to keep to the gods. To do 
this, first drop the item, then type 'SAC <item>'. This will earn you a small 
reward in gold, and also helps to keep the World clean. Another way to get rid
of an item in your inventory is the command 'JUNK <item>'. 
After you are through with the loot go east to the next station.

--

read sign
Sometimes doors to a room are closed, or locked, or 'secret', and then you 
can't see them as you enter the room. You have to type 'look <direction>', 
(for instance 'look east') to find out if there is a closed or locked door in 
that direction. Then you type 'open door' or open 'east' or 'open door east'.
If the door is locked, you have to first type 'unlock door'. 
To unlock a door you must obviously first find the key to it. Usually - but 
not always! - it is hidden in the same room, or a mob in the room has it. 
To find a 'secret' door you have to type SEARCH, and often repeat it a few times.
In some cases the door is a 'portal', then you type 'enter <portal-name>', for 
instance 'enter hole' to get to the next room. 
This is an ordinary door though and it isn't locked, so just type 'look east' 
to see the door and then 'open door east' to open it. It might be a good idea 
to type 'look east' again after you opened the door, to see what dangers may 
lurk in the next room. Then go east to enter the castle.

--

look Joe
Joe would be the easiest one to kill out of all these guys standing here.  You
might have noticed that most of these brothers have a line in front of their
names with different colors on them.  These lines can be seen on MOBS and
players alike.  They will tell you what tier they are at.  To learn what each
color means look at Greg.    
Joe is in excellent condition.

--

look greg
Greg has a different colored bar next to his.  His bar means he is at tier 1.
What are tiers you must be wondering by now?  Well, more detailed information 
on tiers will be found further into the 4D School.  For now you just need to 
know that the higher the tier, the tougher the mob will be.    
The color order of the tiers are:
Tier 1 [white] Tier 2 [cyan] Tier 3 [blue] Tier 4 [red]
Tier 0 (Joe) has no bar next to their name.
For more information about other important things you should know before
going further, look at Jeff.
Greg is in excellent condition.

--

look jeff
Jeff has a different colored bar next to his name.  In case you forgot which
colors are which, or don't know what this means, look at Greg.  Jeff's colored
bar means he is Tier 2.  So he would be a bit harder than Joe and Greg.  At
these low levels found in 4D School, it will be hard to really see the
difference.  But out there in the Dimensions you will find it makes a LOT of
difference whether it is on a mob or a player.  And though you can't see it, you
have a bar next to your name too.  Right now it's probably the same color as
Joe's.  Once you climb up in the tier system, your color will change.
Jeff is in excellent condition.

--

look mike
Mike is the quiet one in this family.  But as you can see by the color of the
bar next to his name, he's a lot tougher than most of them.  The only one
stronger is Pete.  The only thing Mike wants you to know is that if you see a @
symbol next to somebody's name, that means that that is a player just like you.
NOT a mob.  So unless you have a PK flag, it would be wise not to attack
anybody with the @ symbol next to their name. Type nodisplaytitle off, next 
time you see someone in the same room as you and that person is an actual
player, you will then see the @ in front of their name.
For one last very important bit of information, look at Pete.
Mike is in excellent condition.

--

look pete
Pete is the oldest brother of this family.  He's also the toughest.  He has
made it all the way up to tier 4.  Pete thinks you should learn about the
battlespam toggle before you move on in the school.  This is one of the most
informative toggles in the game.
When you have battlespam turned off you will not see what happens when other
players are fighting.
It also means you will not see the affects that mobs, other players, or objects
have on them.
It also means you won't see any experience gains you may get.
It also means you won't see hunger or thirst messages in the game.
Well, this family has told you all they can about quite a few things. Now why
don't you kill them and head back into school.
Pete is in excellent condition.
